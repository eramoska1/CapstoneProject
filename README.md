# CapstoneProject
# A Sentiment analysis of tweets related to several stocks
# Each Tweet was manually assigned a positive,negative, or neutral rating, to form a ground truth. 
# For pre-processing, stop words were removed. Emojis were removed as well, for simplicity. The tweets were then stemmed and tokenized.
# Sentiment computed using lexicon-based ( rules-based ) methods, as well as optimized ML algorithms. 
# The sentiment was then aggregated into an hourly average, which was compared to price movements in those stocks.
